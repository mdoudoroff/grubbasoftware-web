Software License Agreement <br />
Single Use License <br />


<p>PLEASE READ THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT ("LICENSE") CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE. BY USING THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THE LICENSE, YOU MAY RETURN THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU OBTAINED IT FOR A REFUND. IF THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE WAS ACCESSED ELECTRONICALLY, CLICK "DISAGREE/DECLINE".</p>

<p>1. General. The software, documentation and any assets accompanying this License whether on disk, in read only memory, on any other media or in any other form (collectively the "Grubba Software") are licensed, not sold, to you by Grubba Software, Inc. ("Grubba") for use only under the terms of this License, and Grubba reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. The rights granted herein are limited to Grubba's and its licensors' intellectual property rights in the Grubba Software and do not include any other patents or intellectual property rights. You own the media on which the Grubba Software is recorded but Grubba and/or Grubba's licensor(s) retain ownership of the Grubba Software itself. The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades provided by Grubba that replace and/or supplement the original Grubba Software product, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern. </p>


<p>Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by or accessed through the Grubba Software belongs to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third party providing such content. This License does not grant you any rights to use such content.
</p>

<p>2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions. This License allows you to install and use one copy of the Grubba Software on a single computer at a time. This License does not allow the Grubba Software to exist on more than one computer at a time, and you may not make the Grubba Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple computers at the same time. You may make one copy of the Grubba Software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only; provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original. Except as and only to the extent expressly permitted in this License or by applicable law, you may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, modify, or create derivative works of the Grubba Software or any part thereof.</p>


<p>3. Transfer. You may not transfer, rent, lease, lend or sublicense the Grubba Software. All components of the Grubba Software are provided as part of a bundle and may not be separated from the bundle and distributed as standalone applications. 
</p>

<p>Updates: If an Grubba Software update completely replaces (full install) a previously licensed version of the Grubba Software, you may not use both versions of the Grubba Software at the same time nor may you transfer them separately.
</p>

<p>NFR (Not for Resale) Copies: Notwithstanding other sections of this License, Grubba Software labeled or otherwise provided to you on a promotional basis may only be used for demonstration, testing and evaluation purposes and may not be resold, transferred, or used commercially.
</p>

<p>4. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate automatically without notice from Grubba if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Grubba Software and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Grubba Software.
</p>

<p>5. Disclaimer of Warranties. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY ON MEDIA SET FORTH ABOVE AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND GRUBBA AND GRUBBA'S LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "GRUBBA" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 5 AND 6) HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. GRUBBA DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY GRUBBA OR AN GRUBBA AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
</p>

<p>6. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL GRUBBA BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE GRUBBA SOFTWARE, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF GRUBBA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Grubba's total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of five dollars ($5.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.
</p>

<p>7. Export Control. You may not use or otherwise export or reexport the Grubba Software except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Grubba Software was obtained.

By using the Grubba Software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. 
</p>

<p>8. Government End Users. The Grubba Software and related documentation are "Commercial Items", as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable.

<p>9. Controlling Law and Severability. This License will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North Carolina, as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within North Carolina between North Carolina residents. This License shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, the remainder of this License shall continue in full force and effect. 
</p>

<p>10. Complete Agreement; Governing Language. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the use of the Grubba Software licensed hereunder and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding such subject matter. No amendment to or modification of this License will be binding unless in writing and signed by Grubba. Any translation of this License is done for local requirements and in the event of a dispute between the English and any non-English versions, the English version of this License shall govern.
